# 📸 Image Setup Instructions

## Add Your Portrait Photo

To display your photo in the 3D portrait component:

1. **Place your image** in the `public` folder
2. **Name it**: `suyash.jpg`
3. **Recommended size**: 800x800px (square format works best)
4. **Supported formats**: JPG, PNG, WebP

### Quick Setup:

```bash
# Copy your photo to the public folder
cp /path/to/your/photo.jpg "/Users/suyash/website suyash/public/suyash.jpg"
```

### Alternative:

If you don't have a photo ready, the component will show a placeholder with a message. You can add your photo later and it will automatically appear.

**Note**: The portrait component uses a circular frame, so square images work best. The component will automatically handle the circular crop.
